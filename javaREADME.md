Overview
This project demonstrates a basic console-based number-guessing game to deepen my understanding of Java syntax, 
object-oriented principles, and the use of core libraries. The software is designed to challenge users to guess 
a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts, providing feedback and encouraging improvement 
by tracking a “best score.” This exercise was also a great way to explore user input validation, looping constructs, 
and interaction handling in a real-world Java application.

The purpose of this program is to learn practical implementation aspects of Java, including control structures, 
random number generation, and effective user feedback mechanisms. Additionally, I aimed to improve my understanding 
of encapsulating logic in methods and designing a replayable game loop.

Development Environment
IDE: IntelliJ IDEA
Java Version: Java SE 17
Libraries: Core Java libraries java.util.Random for random number generation and java.util.Scanner for handling user input.

Future Work
Add a difficulty selection option to adjust the guessing range.
Implement a graphical interface to make the game more visually engaging.
Track and display player statistics (e.g., average attempts across games).
Allow customization of maximum attempts or range by the player.
